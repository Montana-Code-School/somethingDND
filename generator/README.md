This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

- Welcome to our Tabletop RPG character creator app! to get started, you need to:
  - cd into your root directory, and `npm install`.
  - cd into the generator directory, and `npm install` again.
  - when running on your local host open two terminals, in the first one, in root directory, type `npm run devstart`. this will keep running, updating on
      file changes, and runs the back end server.
  - in the other terminal, in the generator directory, type `npm run start`. this will watch your files, updating and rebuilding on file changes.
